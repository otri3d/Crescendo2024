# RI3D Code for FRC Crescendo 2024

### Description
TBD

### Technical Challenges and the workarounds
TBD

### Notes for usage (Mainly for Thomas):
Please make sure to set the IDs of the constants to fit the robot
Also some of the code might not match up with the functions of the robot as we aren't too sure of the design,
so please take a look before running to see why something goes wrong. Thanks!
